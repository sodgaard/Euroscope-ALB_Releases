# Arrival Load Ballance (ALB) for EuroScope 
A simple arrival manager plugin for EuroScope. Uses the position predictions provided by EuroScope to visualize the arrival flow for a given airport or waypoint.
The project is based on the project AMAN with somewhat different objectives. The development of AMAN was stalled at one point.
