# Arrival Load Ballance (ALB) for EuroScope 
An arrival manager plugin for EuroScope. Uses the position predictions provided by EuroScope to visualize the arrival flow for a given airport or waypoint.
The project is based on the project AMAN with somewhat different objectives. The development of AMAN was stalled at one point.

The user documentation can be found here:
