# Quick Start

Users of ALB can take one of three roles:

1. Standalone user

2. Part of a team for ```<ICAO>``` as regular user

3. Part of a team for ```<ICAO>``` as Flow Manager

## 1. Standalone user

1. Launch EuroScope with ALB enabled.

2. Open the ALB window via the command ```.alb open```.

3. Choose relevant Timeline from the drop down menu. NB: Make sure that the runway selection in the Euroscope menu matches the timeline selection in ALB.

Your options now depend on your connection status in Euroscope. You can use ALB online, playback or  on a sweatbox. As Standalone User you can adjust the setup via manipulating scenario, arrival rate or layout but it will only influence your own instance of ALB.

## 2. Part of a team for ```<ICAO>``` as regular user
Launch is as for standalone user.

If you are part of a team for a given airport <ICAO> and someone else has claimed the role as Flow Management Responsible (FMR) then you will se that indicated in the interface. You should not be changing Scenario or Arrival Rate as this will be overwritten by the FMR.

You can change layout to whatever you prefer.

## 3. Part of a team for ```<ICAO>``` as Flow Manager
The particularities of the Flow Manager Responsible (FMR) is not part of the quick start guide.
